<!--h3><strong>Ramshackle</strong></h3>
<p>Acoustic Blues collaboration Ramshackle will be accompanying the Saturday afternoon session.</p>
<p>RAMSHACKLE is an acoustic based collaboration of musicians from three North Wales and Cheshire bands, with many years of performing experience between them.<br />
From Chester's <i>Blueswagon</i> and <i>Deportees</i> bands we have Frank Neil and Adrian Dear on vocals, harmonica and guitar, while music fans from Mold may recognise  David Clutton, Tim Holdsworth and Dave Clark from Wrexham's <i>Jacobs Ladder</i>, regular performers at pub music nights in town, bringing more vocals, guitar, bass and percussion to the party.<br />
They will be playing a selection of blues, pop and rock classics, in a laid back acoustic style, with the emphasis on a good time being had by all!
