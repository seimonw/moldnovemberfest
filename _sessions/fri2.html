<h3><strong>Fletch</strong></h3>
<p>Fletch are five friends from Chester who have been playing together in ‘Fletch’ for the past 10 years.</p>
<p><i>We’ve played hundreds of gigs to thousands of people and we love what we do! Our set lists are always high-energy and we guarantee to fill any dance floor you put in front of us! We specialise in weddings but we also play lots of corporate events too. Whatever the occasion, our only mission is to get you dancing and put a smile on your face!</i></p>
<p>You may have enjoyed them recently at Mold Food Festival.</p>
