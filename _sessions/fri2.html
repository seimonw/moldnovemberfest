<h3><strong>Six Ton Dog</strong></h3>
<p>
Six Ton Dog are a four piece covers band from North Wales and played their first gig in 2008, covering mainly rock covers interspersed with their own versions of traditional Welsh songs. They can mainly be found playing around the pubs of Flintshire and Denbighshire and are regulars at  local festivals such as Live on the Square and Mold Food and Drink, and headlining the likes of Glastonfynydd, Cymfest and the Ruthin Music and Cider festival, but have also ventured as far as Ireland and Belgium.
They were honoured to be the main entertainment on top of Moel Famau for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and have supported the likes of the Inspiral Carpets and Bruce Foxton (From the Jam), and have also headlined gigs at Coventry City's Ricoh Arena.
