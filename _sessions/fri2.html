<h3><strong>The C90s</strong></h3>
<p>The C90s were formed soon after lockdown, When Mark, placed an ad online looking for like minded musicians, to form a band that didn't play, sweet home Allabama or whiskey in the jar. After a few changes they settled on its current lineup of Amanda Holmes, vocals, Simon Alexander, guitar, Mark Gunning Bass guitar, Mark 'Bonus' Jones, Drums and Tony Warren, Keyboard. The band tries to choose interesting songs whilst picking songs that people remember, but not the songs you'd initially think. From Alanis Morrisette, to Basement Jaxx, Jamiroquai to Pearl jam, there is something for everyone, from all the popular musical movements of the last great decade of music.</p>
