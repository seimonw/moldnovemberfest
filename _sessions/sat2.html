<h3><strong>The Establishment</strong></h3>
<p>The Establishment consists of 5 local lads, who have got together with the aim of bringing guitar music back into mainstream and are looking forward to playing you some tunes! Coming together late 2018, they have been playing gigs locally covering some of the most popular and favoured songs from different generations. As well as covers, The establishment write their own songs and recently released an EP; “Mid-Day Has Come” on Spotify, ITunes and many other streaming platforms.</p>
